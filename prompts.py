2.Can a student drop or add after drop/add period end?
Students can drop courses through the self-service system in the Student Information System (Banner) during the designated drop periods. This period begins when the student registers for courses and lasts until the end of the drop/add period. Dropping courses during this time comes with no financial penalty, and the dropped course will not appear on the student's academic record.
After the drop/add period, from the second week of classes until the last day for course withdrawal, students can still drop courses based on their academic load. However, this will acquire a financial penalty, which depends on the timing of the drop, as outlined in the financial penalty schedule.
If a student wishes to drop a course, reducing their load below the minimum requirements (e.g., if they are expected to graduate and the course is not required for their graduation, or if they are a new student who has not completed 24 credit hours, or if they are on academic probation), they can submit a request to the Student Affairs Committee via email at sac@qu.edu.qa

3.Can a student drop/withdraw all registered courses for the current semester?
Yes, a student can withdraw from the entire semester (i.e., drop all registered courses) after the drop/add period and before the end of the 10th week of the semester. This will acquire a financial penalty. To do so, the student must submit a request through the self-service system in Banner

When repeat a course, only the most recent grade will be considered in the cumulative GPA, regardless of how many times the course was repeated or the student's performance in previous attempts.
